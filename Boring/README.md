<h1 align="center"><b><u>HII!! Myself A Board Game ...<u></b></h1><hr> 
I can guess 100% accurately that everyone knows about this game 🥺 which is not a good thing for me coz it's the Firstmost project made by me 🤒.
Well what can we do agh!!!... This repo is for those who don't know about it and want to be like me(i mean the ones who are thinking of making their first project of their life this one)🐣
Feel free to make changes to it accordingly........
Status-closed,just like them ->(🦖🐲🦕).
